mangopy
=======
This repository contains code for processing all-sky images generated by the Mid-latitude All-sky-imager Network for Geospace Observations (MANGO), a project funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) (Grant \# AGS-1452357). MANGO has a network of 7 all-sky (wide-angle) cameras across the continental United States to observe the ionospheric airglow occurring at the heights of 250-300km. More information at `MANGO <https://mangonetwork.org/>`_.

The mangopy project is a python package for accessing and visualizing MANGO data.  The project has several authors as mentioned in each code header. This code can be applied to image processing of other all-sky data (i.e. systems with wide-angle cameras pointed vertically towards the sky).  The code was developed under two NSF funded projects, MANGO (Grant \# AGS-1452357) and InGeO (Grant \# OAC-1835573).


Installing cartopy
------------------
`Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html>`_ is used for visualizing MANGO data and must be installed before mangopy.  Please refer to the `cartopy installation instructions <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html#installing>`_ and make sure cartopy is successfully installed on your system before attempting to install mangopy.

Installing mangopy
------------------
Mangopy can be installed with pip directly from the GitHub repository::

  pip install git+https://github.com/mangonetwork/mangopy.git
